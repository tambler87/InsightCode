Syllabus for Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Objective: Teach the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using verbal descriptions, simple  code examples, and hands-on activities, ensuring the content is accessible for all learners.

Week 1: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Objective: Explain how each language works in building a webpage using a house analogy to  make it relatable.

Explanation:

• HTML: The structure of a house (foundation and walls).

• CSS: The decoration (paint, furniture, and layout).

• JavaScript: The functionality (electricity and plumbing, making the house work and  respond to actions).

Session Plan:

• Talking Time (5-7 minutes):

o Discuss how HTML forms the walls and foundation, CSS styles the house, and  JavaScript makes it interactive.

o Use simple examples like building a house to explain the role of each language. • Activity Time (7-8 minutes):

o Create a basic webpage using HTML, adding headings and paragraphs.

Code Example (Verbal Description):

Start with <!DOCTYPE html> to define the document type, include <head> for meta info and title,  and wrap the main content in <body>. Use <h1> for the main heading and <p> for a paragraph.

Week 2: Understanding HTML – The Blueprint of a Webpage Objective: Understand how HTML organizes content like the blueprint of a house. Explanation:

• HTML is the blueprint that lays out where everything goes on a webpage. • Tags define different parts (e.g., <h1> for titles, <p> for paragraphs).

• Attributes provide additional instructions (e.g., adding color).

Session Plan:

• Talking Time (5-7 minutes):

o Explain that HTML tags structure the page but are not visible, just like blueprints  aren't visible in the final building.

o Discuss the use of angle brackets < > to enclose tags.

• Activity Time (7-8 minutes):

o Create a simple HTML page with headings and paragraphs.

Code Example (Verbal Description):

For example, use <h1> for a main heading and <p> for paragraphs to create text sections.

Week 3: Introduction to CSS – Decorating Your Webpage

Objective: Add styles to the HTML page from Week 2 using CSS.

Explanation:

• CSS changes how the webpage looks, like painting a house and arranging furniture. • Selectors target elements to style, properties define what to change (e.g., color), and  values specify the details (e.g., red).

Session Plan:

• Talking Time (5-7 minutes):

o Explain how CSS can change colors, fonts, and layouts without altering the  structure.

o Discuss CSS syntax: selectors, properties, and values.

• Activity Time (7-8 minutes):

o Add CSS styling to the HTML page from Week 2, changing colors and fonts.

Code Example (Verbal Description):

For example, style headings with h1 { color: red; } and paragraphs with p { color:  green; }.

Week 4: JavaScript – Bringing Your Webpage to Life

Objective: Introduce JavaScript to make the webpage interactive.

Explanation:

• JavaScript makes a webpage interactive, like adding switches or controls to a house. Session Plan:

• Talking Time (5-7 minutes):

o Explain how JavaScript allows users to interact with a webpage by responding to  actions (e.g., clicking a button).

o Discuss how events trigger JavaScript functions.

• Activity Time (7-8 minutes):

o Add a button that triggers an alert when clicked.

Code Example (Verbal Description):

Create a button that says "Click Me" using onclick="alert('Hello!')" to display an alert  when clicked.

Week 5: Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Objective: Create a complete interactive webpage using all three languages. Explanation:

• HTML forms the structure, CSS adds design, and JavaScript brings the webpage to life  with interaction.

Session Plan:

• Talking Time (5-7 minutes):

o Review how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a functional  webpage.

o Demonstrate a simple project that uses all three.

• Activity Time (7-8 minutes):

o Create a webpage with HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for  interaction.

Code Example (Verbal Description):

Create a button with CSS styling, such as background-color: blue;, and use JavaScript to  change its color when clicked.

Final Notes on Simplifying Syntax

Explanation:

• Tags define the structure of the webpage and are wrapped in angle brackets < >. • Attributes provide additional instructions to modify elements, like changing color.

Example (Verbal Description):

Use the style="color:red;" attribute within a <p> tag to make the text appear in red.

Key HTML Tags:

• <h1> to <h6>: Headings for titles and subheadings.

• <p>: Paragraphs for text.

• <a href="">: Links to other pages.

• <img src="">: Images.

• <div>: Divisions for grouping content.

• <ul>, <ol>, <li>: Lists for bullet points or numbered lists.

• <form>: Forms to collect input.

• <button>: Buttons to trigger actions.
